[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mrecv[22m(), [1mrecvfrom[22m(), and [1mrecvmsg[22m() calls are used to receive messages from
       a  socket.   They may be used to receive data on both connectionless and con‐
       nection-oriented sockets.  This page first describes common features  of  all
       three system calls, and then describes the differences between the calls.

       The  only  difference  between  [1mrecv[22m()  and [1mread[22m(2) is the presence of [4mflags[24m.
       With a zero [4mflags[24m argument, [1mrecv[22m() is generally equivalent  to  [1mread[22m(2)  (but
       see NOTES).  Also, the following call

           recv(sockfd, buf, len, flags);

       is equivalent to

           recvfrom(sockfd, buf, len, flags, NULL, NULL);

       All  three  calls  return the length of the message on successful completion.
       If a message is too long to fit in the supplied buffer, excess bytes  may  be
       discarded depending on the type of socket the message is received from.

       If no messages are available at the socket, the receive calls wait for a mes‐
       sage  to  arrive,  unless  the socket is nonblocking (see [1mfcntl[22m(2)), in which
       case the value -1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to [1mEAGAIN [22mor [1mEWOULDBLOCK[22m.  The
       receive calls normally return any data available, up to the requested amount,
       rather than waiting for receipt of the full amount requested.

       An application can use [1mselect[22m(2), [1mpoll[22m(2), or [1mepoll[22m(7) to determine when more
       data arrives on a socket.

   [1mThe flags argument[0m
       The [4mflags[24m argument is formed by ORing one or more of the following values:

       [1mMSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC [22m([1mrecvmsg[22m() only; since Linux 2.6.23)
              Set the close-on-exec flag for the file descriptor received via a UNIX
              domain file descriptor using the [1mSCM_RIGHTS  [22moperation  (described  in
              [1munix[22m(7)).   This  flag is useful for the same reasons as the [1mO_CLOEXEC[0m
              flag of [1mopen[22m(2).

       [1mMSG_DONTWAIT [22m(since Linux 2.2)
              Enables nonblocking operation; if the operation would block, the  call
              fails with the error [1mEAGAIN [22mor [1mEWOULDBLOCK[22m.  This provides similar be‐
              havior to setting the [1mO_NONBLOCK [22mflag (via the [1mfcntl[22m(2) [1mF_SETFL [22mopera‐
              tion),  but differs in that [1mMSG_DONTWAIT [22mis a per-call option, whereas
              [1mO_NONBLOCK [22mis a setting on the open file  description  (see  [1mopen[22m(2)),
              which  will affect all threads in the calling process as well as other
              processes that hold file descriptors referring to the same  open  file
              description.

       [1mMSG_ERRQUEUE [22m(since Linux 2.2)
              This  flag  specifies  that  queued errors should be received from the
              socket error queue.  The error is passed in an ancillary message  with
              a  type  dependent  on  the  protocol (for IPv4 [1mIP_RECVERR[22m).  The user
              should supply a buffer of sufficient size.  See [1mcmsg[22m(3) and [1mip[22m(7)  for
              more  information.  The payload of the original packet that caused the
              error is passed as normal data via [4mmsg_iovec[24m.  The  original  destina‐
              tion  address  of  the  datagram that caused the error is supplied via
              [4mmsg_name[24m.

              The error is supplied in a [4msock_extended_err[24m structure:

                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_NONE    0
                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_LOCAL   1
                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP    2
                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP6   3

                  struct sock_extended_err
                  {
                      uint32_t ee_errno;   /* Error number */
                      uint8_t  ee_origin;  /* Where the error originated */
                      uint8_t  ee_type;    /* Type */
                      uint8_t  ee_code;    /* Code */
                      uint8_t  ee_pad;     /* Padding */
                      uint32_t ee_info;    /* Additional information */
                      uint32_t ee_data;    /* Other data */
                      /* More data may follow */
                  };

                  struct sockaddr *SO_EE_OFFENDER(struct sock_extended_err *);

              [4mee_errno[24m contains the [4merrno[24m number of the queued error.  [4mee_origin[24m  is
              the  origin  code of where the error originated.  The other fields are
              protocol-specific.  The macro [1mSO_EE_OFFENDER [22mreturns a pointer to  the
              address  of the network object where the error originated from given a
              pointer to the ancillary message.  If this address is not  known,  the
              [4msa_family[24m  member  of  the  [4msockaddr[24m  contains [1mAF_UNSPEC [22mand the other
              fields of the [4msockaddr[24m are undefined.  The payload of the packet  that
              caused the error is passed as normal data.

              For  local  errors, no address is passed (this can be checked with the
              [4mcmsg_len[24m member of the [4mcmsghdr[24m).  For error receives, the [1mMSG_ERRQUEUE[0m
              flag is set in the [4mmsghdr[24m.  After an error has been passed, the  pend‐
              ing  socket  error  is  regenerated based on the next queued error and
              will be passed on the next socket operation.

       [1mMSG_OOB[0m
              This flag requests receipt of out-of-band data that would not  be  re‐
              ceived in the normal data stream.  Some protocols place expedited data
              at  the  head  of  the normal data queue, and thus this flag cannot be
              used with such protocols.

       [1mMSG_PEEK[0m
              This flag causes the receive operation to return data from the  begin‐
              ning  of  the receive queue without removing that data from the queue.
              Thus, a subsequent receive call will return the same data.

       [1mMSG_TRUNC [22m(since Linux 2.2)
              For raw ([1mAF_PACKET[22m), Internet  datagram  (since  Linux  2.4.27/2.6.8),
              netlink  (since Linux 2.6.22), and UNIX datagram as well as sequenced-
              packet (since Linux 3.4) sockets: return the real length of the packet
              or datagram, even when it was longer than the passed buffer.

              For use with Internet stream sockets, see [1mtcp[22m(7).

       [1mMSG_WAITALL [22m(since Linux 2.2)
              This flag requests that the operation block until the full request  is
              satisfied.   However,  the  call  may  still return less data than re‐
              quested if a signal is caught, an error or disconnect occurs,  or  the
              next  data  to  be received is of a different type than that returned.
              This flag has no effect for datagram sockets.

   [1mrecvfrom()[0m
       [1mrecvfrom[22m() places the received message into the buffer [4mbuf[24m.  The caller  must
       specify the size of the buffer in [4mlen[24m.

       If  [4msrc_addr[24m is not NULL, and the underlying protocol provides the source ad‐
       dress of the message, that source address is placed in the buffer pointed  to
       by  [4msrc_addr[24m.   In this case, [4maddrlen[24m is a value-result argument.  Before the
       call, it should be initialized to the size  of  the  buffer  associated  with
       [4msrc_addr[24m.   Upon return, [4maddrlen[24m is updated to contain the actual size of the
       source address.  The returned address is truncated if the buffer provided  is
       too  small;  in  this case, [4maddrlen[24m will return a value greater than was sup‐
       plied to the call.

       If the caller is not interested in the source address, [4msrc_addr[24m  and  [4maddrlen[0m
       should be specified as NULL.

   [1mrecv()[0m
       The [1mrecv[22m() call is normally used only on a [4mconnected[24m socket (see [1mconnect[22m(2)).
       It is equivalent to the call:

           recvfrom(fd, buf, len, flags, NULL, 0);

   [1mrecvmsg()[0m
       The [1mrecvmsg[22m() call uses a [4mmsghdr[24m structure to minimize the number of directly
       supplied arguments.  This structure is defined as follows in [4m<sys/socket.h>[24m:

           struct msghdr {
               void         *msg_name;       /* Optional address */
               socklen_t     msg_namelen;    /* Size of address */
               struct iovec *msg_iov;        /* Scatter/gather array */
               size_t        msg_iovlen;     /* # elements in msg_iov */
               void         *msg_control;    /* Ancillary data, see below */
               size_t        msg_controllen; /* Ancillary data buffer len */
               int           msg_flags;      /* Flags on received message */
           };

       The [4mmsg_name[24m field points to a caller-allocated buffer that is used to return
       the  source  address  if  the  socket  is unconnected.  The caller should set
       [4mmsg_namelen[24m to the size of this buffer before this call; upon return  from  a
       successful call, [4mmsg_namelen[24m will contain the length of the returned address.
       If  the application does not need to know the source address, [4mmsg_name[24m can be
       specified as NULL.

       The fields [4mmsg_iov[24m and [4mmsg_iovlen[24m describe scatter-gather locations, as  dis‐
       cussed in [1mreadv[22m(2).

       The  field  [4mmsg_control[24m,  which has length [4mmsg_controllen[24m, points to a buffer
       for other protocol control-related messages or miscellaneous ancillary  data.
       When  [1mrecvmsg[22m()  is  called,  [4mmsg_controllen[24m should contain the length of the
       available buffer in [4mmsg_control[24m; upon return from a successful call  it  will
       contain the length of the control message sequence.

       The messages are of the form:

           struct cmsghdr {
               size_t cmsg_len;    /* Data byte count, including header
                                      (type is socklen_t in POSIX) */
               int    cmsg_level;  /* Originating protocol */
               int    cmsg_type;   /* Protocol-specific type */
           /* followed by
               unsigned char cmsg_data[]; */
           };

       Ancillary data should be accessed only by the macros defined in [1mcmsg[22m(3).

       As  an example, Linux uses this ancillary data mechanism to pass extended er‐
       rors, IP options, or file descriptors over UNIX domain sockets.  For  further
       information  on  the  use  of  ancillary  data in various socket domains, see
       [1munix[22m(7) and [1mip[22m(7).

       The [4mmsg_flags[24m field in the [4mmsghdr[24m is set on return of [1mrecvmsg[22m().  It can con‐
       tain several flags:

       [1mMSG_EOR[0m
              indicates end-of-record; the data returned completed a record  (gener‐
              ally used with sockets of type [1mSOCK_SEQPACKET[22m).

       [1mMSG_TRUNC[0m
              indicates  that  the  trailing portion of a datagram was discarded be‐
              cause the datagram was larger than the buffer supplied.

       [1mMSG_CTRUNC[0m
              indicates that some control data was discarded due to lack of space in
              the buffer for ancillary data.

       [1mMSG_OOB[0m
              is returned to indicate that expedited or  out-of-band  data  was  re‐
              ceived.

       [1mMSG_ERRQUEUE[0m
              indicates  that  no  data  was received but an extended error from the
              socket error queue.

       [1mMSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC [22m(since Linux 2.6.23)
              indicates that [1mMSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC [22mwas specified in the [4mflags[24m argument of
              [1mrecvmsg[22m().

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       These calls return the number of bytes received, or -1 if an error  occurred.
       In the event of an error, [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

       When a stream socket peer has performed an orderly shutdown, the return value
       will be 0 (the traditional "end-of-file" return).

       Datagram  sockets  in  various  domains (e.g., the UNIX and Internet domains)
       permit zero-length datagrams.  When such a datagram is received,  the  return
       value is 0.

       The  value 0 may also be returned if the requested number of bytes to receive
       from a stream socket was 0.

[1mERRORS[0m
       These are some standard errors generated by the socket layer.  Additional er‐
       rors may be generated and returned from the underlying protocol modules;  see
       their manual pages.

       [1mEAGAIN [22mor [1mEWOULDBLOCK[0m
              The  socket  is  marked  nonblocking  and  the receive operation would
              block, or a receive timeout had been set and the timeout  expired  be‐
              fore  data  was  received.  POSIX.1 allows either error to be returned
              for this case, and does not require these constants to have  the  same
              value, so a portable application should check for both possibilities.

       [1mEBADF  [22mThe argument [4msockfd[24m is an invalid file descriptor.

       [1mECONNREFUSED[0m
              A  remote  host refused to allow the network connection (typically be‐
              cause it is not running the requested service).

       [1mEFAULT [22mThe receive buffer pointer(s)  point  outside  the  process's  address
              space.

       [1mEINTR  [22mThe  receive  was  interrupted by delivery of a signal before any data
              was available; see [1msignal[22m(7).

       [1mEINVAL [22mInvalid argument passed.

       [1mENOMEM [22mCould not allocate memory for [1mrecvmsg[22m().

       [1mENOTCONN[0m
              The socket is associated with a connection-oriented protocol  and  has
              not been connected (see [1mconnect[22m(2) and [1maccept[22m(2)).

       [1mENOTSOCK[0m
              The file descriptor [4msockfd[24m does not refer to a socket.

[1mVERSIONS[0m
       According to POSIX.1, the [4mmsg_controllen[24m field of the [4mmsghdr[24m structure should
       be  typed  as [4msocklen_t[24m, and the [4mmsg_iovlen[24m field should be typed as [4mint[24m, but
       glibc currently types both as [4msize_t[24m.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m

[1mHISTORY[0m
       POSIX.1-2001, 4.4BSD (first appeared in 4.2BSD).

       POSIX.1 describes only the [1mMSG_OOB[22m, [1mMSG_PEEK[22m, and [1mMSG_WAITALL [22mflags.

[1mNOTES[0m
       If a zero-length datagram is pending, [1mread[22m(2) and [1mrecv[22m() with a  [4mflags[24m  argu‐
       ment  of  zero provide different behavior.  In this circumstance, [1mread[22m(2) has
       no effect (the datagram remains pending), while [1mrecv[22m() consumes  the  pending
       datagram.

       See  [1mrecvmmsg[22m(2)  for information about a Linux-specific system call that can
       be used to receive multiple datagrams in a single call.
